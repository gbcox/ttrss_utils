#!/usr/bin/env bash
# This script is not intended to be run standalone.  It will be called
# from other utilities.
#
# This script will merge changes into your config.php from config.php-dist
# The assumption is that config.php-dist changes are authoritative
# This means that if something changes in config.php-dist those changes
# will be merged into your config.php
# Changes made to your config.php will be preserved only if they are made to
# a define statement AND that define statement has not been changed in config.php-dist
# from the time it was originally cloned into your config.php
# If a define has been changed, it will replace whatever you had in your config.php
# The assumption being this is something which requires manual intervention
#
# Your config.php will be built based upon four conditions:
# TTRSS DEFAULT:  This statement matches what is in config.php-dist
# $HOST OVERRIDE:  You have customized the entry from config.php-dist
# TTRSS CHANGE:  The dist copy has changed on a modified record, you need to manually redo 
# NEW OPTION FOUND: A new option has been added during this update 
# 
# Previous versions of your config.php will be kept for 14 days
